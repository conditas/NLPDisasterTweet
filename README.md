# NLPDisasterTweet

This is repository for week 4 Intro to Deep Learning Class. This project uses Natural Language Processing and a Recurrent Neural Netwrok Model (RNN) for the Kaggle Competition "Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets." It involves being able to predict and classify whether twitter texts are about an actual disaster event or not.
